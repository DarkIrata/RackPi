Pages can either inherit from *PageBase* or *MultiPageBase*
### PageBase:
Available Methods:
```python
    def EnterPage(self):            # Called on entering the page
        pass
    def LeavePage(self):            # Called on leaving the page
        pass
    def UpdateCanvas(self):         # Called on every update tick
        if not self.CanUpdate({UPDATE_AFTER_TICKLS}):     # To reduce cpu usage, check by CanUpdate with given Ticks amount
            return
        pass
    def OnLongPress(self):          # Called when button is long pressed
        pass
```
Perfectly for text display with Trigger Actions. Example Rebooting the device

### MultiPageBase(PageBase):
Available Methods:
```python
    def EnterPage(self):            # Called on entering the page (Main Page, not sub-pages)
        pass
    def LeavePage(self):            # Called on leaving the page (Main Page, not sub-pages)
        pass
    def UpdateCanvas(self):         # Called on every update tick
        if not self.CanUpdate({UPDATE_AFTER_TICKLS}):     # To reduce cpu usage, check by CanUpdate with given Ticks amount
            return
        pass
